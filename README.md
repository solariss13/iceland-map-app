I'm creating an interactive map of Iceland!

The built process of the project can be separated in three parts:
- displaying map of Iceland divided by regions & displaying region's name when hovered over (already achieved)
- displaying detailed map of chosen region 
- displaying marked spots with interesting places on the map & showing photos of these places taken from Instagram hashtags related to these places

Future goals:
-option for users to add spots on the map
