**All of the goals achieved! ** 

App description:

I'm creating an interactive map of Iceland!

The built process of the project can be separated in parts:
- displaying map of Iceland divided by regions & displaying region's name when hovered over 
- displaying detailed map of chosen region 
- displaying marked spots with interesting places on the map & showing photos of these places taken from Google Images results related to these places
-option for users to add markers on the map 

**Issues**:
After reaching the last step in completing the app it became clear that it's not possible to use Instagram API and instead of that I had to resolve fetching images with Customer Search API provided by Google.
